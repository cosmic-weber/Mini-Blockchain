# Mini-Blockchain

In this repository I have prepared a mini blockchain which creates genesis block on creation of a new blockchain and adds all of the transactions in the chain and it validates the chain on the basis of hash and nonce if their is any sort of modification in the transaction for example any fake transaction then the validate_chain method will prints the bool response of it's correctness.
